    <span class="sss">Swirl, Scuffle, Sequel: An Episo-demic Saga</span> is a 100% 
    student-led online exhibition for the public good, 
    with the participation of multiple groups from 
    individual international students or their start-up 
    projects or teams from major universities in North America.
    <br/><br/>
    In the unpredictable "post-epidemic era", our mission is 
    becoming increasingly difficult: therefore, ULand, 
    together with the New College China Student Association,
    is now planning to launch an online "cloud" exhibition 
    for "art and design universities and other creative projects
    around the world". The "Cloud" exhibition will give art and 
    design students a platform to showcase their creations, and 
    at the same time implement the spirit and ethos of the New 
    School, from the perspective of "supporting the new generation
    of young artists, designers and new talents in the field of 
    culture and creativity in China". We will share the opportunity
    to participate in this art exhibition and the opportunity to 
    improve their background after their works are selected to 
    every student in the related fields.

 <center>Act I - Swirl</center>  
  At the beginning of every disaster, 
  epidemic and crisis, everyone's life seems 
  to be sucked into a huge whirlpool.
  <br/> <br/>
 <center>Act II - Scuffle </center> 
  In the midst of the disasters, epidemics
   and crises that swept the world, people fought 
   against them as if they were caught in a short 
   but chaotic struggle.
   <br/> <br/>
 <center>Act III - Sequel</center> 
  As disasters, epidemics and crises fade away, 
  people embrace calm again. Light years away, each 
  seemingly tragic crisis in fact becomes a star point 
  in the history of mankind and the world, becoming the
   latest chapter in the sequence called "mega-disaster".
